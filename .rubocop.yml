Style/IndentationConsistency:
  # The difference between `rails` and `normal` is that the `rails` style
  # prescribes that in classes and modules the `protected` and `private`
  # modifier keywords shall be indented the same as public methods and that
  # protected and private members shall be indented one step more than the
  # modifiers. Other than that, both styles mean that entities on the same
  # logical depth shall have the same indentation.
